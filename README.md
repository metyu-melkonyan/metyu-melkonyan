## About Me

I am an MEng student specializing in biomedical engineering with a strong academic foundation in bioinformatics from the University of Toronto-St. George. I am transitioning from a pure science background to biomedical engineering, focusing on compatibility and integration, functionality and performance, and scalability and customization. My expertise lies in structural biology, robotics, and the application of machine learning and deep learning to biomedical challenges
