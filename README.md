## About Me

I am a MEng student with a strong academic foundation in bioinformatics, earning my HBSc from the University of Toronto-St. George. My undergraduate thesis focused on integrating multimer compatibility into macromolecular docking applications via a web-based Bio-Analytics Resource (BAR). My research interests span structural biology, robotics, and the application of machine learning and deep learning to scientific data analysis. I am proficient in four languages: Turkish, Armenian, English, and French
